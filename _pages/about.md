## Biography📖

My name is Mohammad Mashreghi. I'm a four-year EE B.S Candidate at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), supervised by Prof. [Hamed Kebriaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDseLNYAAAAJ&hl=en). My interests are mainly in Machine learning and Data science in Finance, Reinforcement Learning,Disturbuted Optimization , and I also love programming. :)
